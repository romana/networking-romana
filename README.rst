Romana Networking

Romana network software lets data center operators design and deploy
multi-tenant cloud computing networks directly on their physical infrastructure
without a virtual network overlay. Romana based networks are less expensive to
build, easier to operate and deliver higher performance than overlay-based
virtual networks.
