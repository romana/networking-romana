Romana Networking

Romana is a new Software Defined Network solution specifically designed for Cloud Native applications. Romana allows multi-tenant cloud computing networks for OpenStack, Docker and Kubernetes to be built without encapsulation or a virtual network overlay.

Romana networks are less expensive to build, easier to operate and deliver higher performance than networks built using alternative overlay based SDN designs.

OpenStack ML2 Driver

This repository contains the code for the OpenStack ML2 driver that allows Romana to be use as a back end network provider for OpenStack. It forwards OpenStack network API calls to Romana services to provide IP addresses and sets up the proper network configuration on Compute Hosts.
